# Patient Selection for Diabetes Drug Testing - Udacity Nanodegree

This project was submitted as part of Udacity's AI for Healthcare Nanodegree. It uses EHR data to build a regression model to predict patient hospitalization time. The aim is to select patients for a new diabetes drug trial. The model is built using TensorFlow, and evaluated for accuracy, demographic bias and fairness across key demographic groups.
